            <li style="color: white;">The show was a hit on many platforms, however it had a dark theme about war, death, fights but with visuals that contrast it, it also had a great story.</li>
            <li style="color: white;">The series has spawned a hated spin-off , several games, and merch. Silly cats is beloved by many and is held as the best series about cats ever.</li>
